# Recipe Application

An application for mobile devices, which allows users to search for recipes using the meal's name, or the names of the ingredients they wish to use.
Application is written in Flutter and Spring. The database I'm using is Firebase, which is a NoSQL database. The external recipe API is provided by Spoonacular.

# Features

- adding recipes to favorites for easy access
- adding reviews of recipes
- automatically adjusts your searches with your meal preferences (allergies/intolerances/cuisines)
- adding items to your personal pantry, which allows you to search for recipes using these ingredients
- adding reminders, which allow you to set reminders for tasks done in the recipe
